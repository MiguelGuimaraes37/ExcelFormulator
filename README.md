Soooooooo... I was challenged by a company to develop a mobile application in just 3 days. 

The goal? To receive an Excel file 📄, allow the user to give feedback directly in the app and, at the end, export a new file with that information 📝.

I decided to use OutSystems for the development because I felt that, given the limited time, it was one of the technologies with the best foundation for working quickly and efficiently ⚙️

🎥 I've also prepared a short demo review of the application:
